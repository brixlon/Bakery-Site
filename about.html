                <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
                <p>Sweet Delights Bakery was founded in 2004 with a simple mission: to bring authentic, handcrafted baked goods to our community. What began as a small storefront with a single oven has grown into a beloved local institution, but our core values remain unchanged.</p>
                <p>Our founder, Maria Rodriguez, learned the art of baking from her grandmother in Italy. Those traditional techniques, combined with years of experience and a passion for quality, form the foundation of everything we create today.</p>

                <h2>Our Process</h2>
                <p>Every day begins before dawn. Our bakers arrive early to start the long fermentation process for our sourdough breads, prepare the laminated dough for our croissants, and mix the batters for our cakes and pastries. We believe that great baking cannot be rushed.</p>
                <p>We use traditional methods wherever possible - hand-kneading our bread dough, rolling our croissants by hand, and decorating our cakes with meticulous attention to detail. While this takes more time, the results speak for themselves in every bite.</p>

                <h2>Our Ingredients</h2>
                <p>Quality starts with quality ingredients. We source our flour from trusted mills, use European-style butter for our pastries, and select only the finest chocolate, fruits, and nuts. We work with local suppliers whenever possible, supporting our community while ensuring freshness.</p>
                <p>We never compromise on quality. You won't find artificial preservatives, flavors, or shortcuts in our kitchen. Every ingredient is chosen for its contribution to the final product's taste and texture.</p>
